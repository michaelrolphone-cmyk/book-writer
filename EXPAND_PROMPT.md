Expand only the current paragraph or section with more detail. Use the surrounding
context to maintain continuity, but do not repeat it. Do not add chapter titles,
headings, or section separators. Return only the expanded markdown for the
current paragraph or section.

While expanding:
- Preserve viewpoint, tense, and the existing voice.
- Keep continuity consistent (setting, time, clothing, object ownership).
- Do not contradict nearby paragraphs; resolve conflicts by aligning details.
- Add at most 1–2 bridging sentences if a transition is missing.
- Limit metaphors; choose the strongest motif and cut the rest.
- Favor concrete actions over abstract labels.
